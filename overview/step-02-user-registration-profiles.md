# Step 2: User Registration and Profile Management

## Overview
This step builds the complete user registration system for all user roles (Player, Coach, Club, Partner, State Committee) with role-specific forms, file upload capabilities via Cloudinary, and comprehensive profile management. Each registration form includes Mexican-specific fields (CURP, RFC, INE) and privacy policy acceptance.
Before rendering a page, all required data for the page should be prepared from backend through API endpoint to store on Redux.
For each page, you must accurately determine whether the functionalities of all dynamic elements, including buttons, are correctly integrated with the backend and accurately reflected in Redux to ensure real-time updates.
There are already data seeded to test in database .
You need to test with only this database seeded data from backend.
Don't use any mockup, simulation or random data for frontend.

## Objectives
- Create role-specific registration forms
- Implement Cloudinary file upload for photos and documents
- Build profile management systems for all user types
- Add Mexican states integration
- Create privacy policy system
- Build profile editing functionality
