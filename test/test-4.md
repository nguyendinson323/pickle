# Test-4: Player Finder System Integration Testing

## Purpose
Test complete Player Finder system integration using only seeded database data. Verify location-based player matching, privacy controls, notification system, and premium feature access work seamlessly between frontend and backend.

## Critical Testing Requirements
1. **Only seeded database data** - No mockups, simulations, or random data
2. **Data type verification** - All API requests/responses must match TypeScript interfaces
3. **Immediate error resolution** - Analyze code structure, fix immediately, and retest
4. **UI element accessibility** - All elements (navigation, buttons, forms, maps) must be visually present and functional
5. **Complete integration flow** - Frontend → Button → API → Backend → Controller → Response → Frontend → Redux → UI Update

## Setup
```bash
# Start servers and ensure seeded data including player locations
cd backend && npm run seed && npm run dev &
cd frontend && npm run dev &

# Verify location and player finder data is seeded
cd backend && npm run seed:player-finder  # If separate seeder exists
```

## Test Credentials (All password: `a`)
- Premium Player: `player1@federacionpickleball.mx`
- Regular Player: `player2@federacionpickleball.mx` 
- Coach: `coach1@federacionpickleball.mx`
- Admin: `admin@federacionpickleball.mx`
