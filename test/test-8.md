# Test-8: Payment System Integration Testing

## Purpose
Test complete Payment and Membership system integration using only seeded database data. Verify Stripe integration, subscription management, tournament payments, court booking payments, refund processing, and billing administration work seamlessly between frontend and backend.

## Critical Testing Requirements
1. **Only seeded database data** - No mockups, simulations, or random data
2. **Data type verification** - All API requests/responses must match TypeScript interfaces
3. **Immediate error resolution** - Analyze code structure, fix immediately, and retest
4. **UI element accessibility** - All elements (payment forms, subscription interfaces, billing dashboards) must be visually present and functional
5. **Complete integration flow** - Frontend → Button → API → Backend → Controller → Response → Frontend → Redux → UI Update

## Setup
```bash
# Start servers and ensure seeded data including payment plans and test data
cd backend && npm run seed && npm run dev &
cd frontend && npm run dev &

# Ensure Stripe test environment configured
# Verify subscription plans and payment data seeded
cd backend && npm run seed:payments  # If separate seeder exists
```
