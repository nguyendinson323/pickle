# Test-6: Tournament Management System Integration Testing

## Purpose
Test complete Tournament Management system integration using only seeded database data. Verify tournament creation, player registration, bracket generation, match management, payment processing, and role-based permissions work seamlessly between frontend and backend.

## Critical Testing Requirements
1. **Only seeded database data** - No mockups, simulations, or random data
2. **Data type verification** - All API requests/responses must match TypeScript interfaces
3. **Immediate error resolution** - Analyze code structure, fix immediately, and retest
4. **UI element accessibility** - All elements (tournament forms, brackets, registration) must be visually present and functional
5. **Complete integration flow** - Frontend → Button → API → Backend → Controller → Response → Frontend → Redux → UI Update

## Setup
```bash
# Start servers and ensure seeded data including tournaments
cd backend && npm run seed && npm run dev &
cd frontend && npm run dev &

# Verify tournament data is seeded
cd backend && npm run seed:tournaments  # If separate seeder exists
```

## Test Credentials (All password: `a`)
- Federation Admin: `admin@federacionpickleball.mx`
- State Committee: `state1@federacionpickleball.mx` (if seeded)
- Club Organizer: `club1@federacionpickleball.mx`
- Partner Organizer: `partner1@federacionpickleball.mx`
- Player: `player1@federacionpickleball.mx`
- Coach: `coach1@federacionpickleball.mx`
