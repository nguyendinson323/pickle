# Test-9: Notification System Integration Testing

## Purpose
Test complete Notification System integration using only seeded database data. Verify multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, push, in-app), notification preferences, delivery tracking, template management, and real-time notification delivery work seamlessly between frontend and backend.

## Critical Testing Requirements
1. **Only seeded database data** - No mockups, simulations, or random data
2. **Data type verification** - All API requests/responses must match TypeScript interfaces
3. **Immediate error resolution** - Analyze code structure, fix immediately, and retest
4. **UI element accessibility** - All elements (notification centers, preference panels, alerts) must be visually present and functional
5. **Complete integration flow** - Frontend → Button → API → Backend → Controller → Response → Frontend → Redux → UI Update

## Setup
```bash
# Start servers and ensure seeded data including notification preferences and templates
cd backend && npm run seed && npm run dev &
cd frontend && npm run dev &

# Configure notification services (SendGrid, Twilio) for testing
# Verify notification data is seeded
cd backend && npm run seed:notifications  # If separate seeder exists
```

## Test Credentials (All password: `a`)
- Player with notifications: `player1@federacionpickleball.mx`
- Club with notifications: `club1@federacionpickleball.mx`
- Coach with notifications: `coach1@federacionpickleball.mx`
